Brick_Game
==========
This works on Python 3.1.1 with the livewires module.

As of 8/22/13
=============

I can make the ball bounce off of the paddle and all walls, except the bottom.  However I am unable
to get the ball to bounce off of a brick (and destroy it) and make multiple copies of that brick class.
Either I make a bunch of bricks with no attributes in the game or I make only 1 brick that does everything
a brick should do.
